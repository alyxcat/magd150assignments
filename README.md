# Magd 150 Assignments 

### This is the repository for my Magd 150 projects from Fall '21 at UW-Whitewater

[Here is the link to Lab 1- Composition in Black and White](https://github.com/alyxcat/magd150assignments/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab01_Aberdeen). 
The objective of this lab was to learn how to use P5.js 
by creating basic shapes and using stroke and fill to create buildings. 

[Here is the link to Lab 2- Static Compositions in Color](https://github.com/alyxcat/magd150assignments/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab02_Aberdeen).
The objective of this lab was to create a space themed image 
with a focus on compositional elements like color and shape. 

[Here is the link to Lab 3- Math](https://github.com/alyxcat/magd150assignments/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab03_Aberdeen). The objective of this lab was to use math operators and math references in the p5.js 
library to create a bubble themed composition. 

[Here is the link to Lab 8- Type and image](https://github.com/alyxcat/magd150assignments/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150_lab08_Aberdeen). The objective of this lab was to create a movie poster, and mine is based off of Magd 150. This lab focused on graphic design elements like filters, typography, and images. [Here is an additional link from p5.js to see it](https://editor.p5js.org/alyxcat/full/GCQghRu7d).

[Here is the link to Lab 10- 3D and Data](https://github.com/alyxcat/magd150assignments/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab10_Aberdeen). The objective of this lab was to create a city using 3D shapes. I used rectangles
for buildings, floating shapes (torus, cone), and created a moving terrain as mountains in the city. 
The objective of this lab was to use textures, camera angles, and lighting to create a dynamic 3D composition.
