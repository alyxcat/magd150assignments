# Magd 150 Assignments 

This is the repository for my Magd 150 projects from Fall '21 at UW-Whitewater

[Here is the link to Lab 2- Static Compositions in Color]. The objective of this lab was to create a space themed image 
with a focus on compositional elements like color and shape. 

[Here is the link to lab 8- Type and image]. The objective of this lab was to create a movie poster, and mine is based
off of Magd 150. This lab focused on graphic design elements like filters, typography, and images.

[Here is the link to lab 10- 3D and Data]. The objective of this lab was to create a city using 3D shapes. I used rectangles for buildings, floating shapes (torus, cone), and created a moving terrain as mountains in the city. The objective of this lab was to use textures, camera angles, and lighting to create a dynamic 3D composition.
